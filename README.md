# Nebula HTML5 Template

Nebula theme is the Pixonauta.com official template.
This represents the 3rd version of the blog, in a fresher and more usable redesign to the previous [Uxtify theme](https://github.com/angelmavare/uxtify-theme).

The template was build using Bootstrap 5 as framework and Sass as CSS preprocessor
